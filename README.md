# Potential Solutions for Alert Management Ticketing System

## Open-Source Solutions

### 1. Prometheus + Alertmanager
- **Prometheus** is a popular open-source monitoring and alerting system.
- **Alertmanager** is a component of Prometheus that handles alerts sent by server applications.
- Supports deduplication, grouping, and silencing of alerts.
- Allows for alert routing and notification configuration.
- Provides a web UI for managing and visualizing alerts.

### 2. Grafana + Loki
- **Grafana** is a popular open-source visualization and analytics platform.
- **Loki** is a horizontally scalable, highly available log aggregation system.
- Allows for log aggregation and alerting based on log patterns.
- Provides a rich query language for filtering and processing logs.
- Integrates well with Prometheus for combined metrics and log analysis.

Prometheus+Alertmanager & Grafana+Loki do complement each other - Loki helps with creating alerts based on the application's logs, and Prometheus collects the metrics and reports everything to Alertmanager, which can then propagate the alerts to Grafana. Grafana can be the central part of the alerting system where every alert is then processed in a defined way.
